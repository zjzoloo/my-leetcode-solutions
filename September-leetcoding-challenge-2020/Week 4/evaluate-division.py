# You are given equations in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings, 
# and k is a real number (floating-point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, 
# return -1.0.
# The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is
# no contradiction.

# Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
# Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
# Explanation: 
# Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
# queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
# return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]

# Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
# Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]

# Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
# Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
