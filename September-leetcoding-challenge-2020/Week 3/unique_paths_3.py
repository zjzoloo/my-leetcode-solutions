# On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:

# 1 represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
# 2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
# 0 represents empty squares we can walk over.
# -1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.
# Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, 
# that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

# Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
# 1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
# 2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)

# Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: We have the following four paths: 
# 1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
# 2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
# 3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
# 4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)

# Input: [[0,1],[2,0]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: 
# There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
# Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.
